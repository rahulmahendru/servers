# Servers

This repository is a collection of basic level HTTP server modules which include a single threaded server, a multi-threaded server and a load balancer. All of these were implemented as part of class assignments in a Introduction to Operating Systems class.

# Single Threaded Server
This version of the server is created to handle a single thread at a time. The module responds to the PUT, GET and HEAD commands to write, read and provide information about the files respectively.
