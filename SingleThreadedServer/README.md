Build:
The 'httpserver' program can be built by running the make command on the command terminal.
In order to run the program, call the executable file 'httpserver' followed by the port number as the program argument. Multiple program arguments are not allowed. The server is then set and ready to respons to client requests.
The server is single-threaded. However, after working on one request, it waits to recieve the next request from the client.

Bugs:
The program does not encounter any bugs at the moment. It passes all the git tests. It performed fine on the manual tests as well.
